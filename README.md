# Data - FinOps Foundation

We started this repository to hold some of the State of FinOps Data, when questions had a lot of 'Other' specified responses. This can be referenced and used in multiple ways by the FinOps community. 

In the future, we could continue to add other areas of data such as job descriptions or a curated data file from the State of FinOps.
